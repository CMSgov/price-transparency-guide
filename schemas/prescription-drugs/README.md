The `historical_net_price` is the average dollar price for the 90-day period beginning 180 days before the file publication date, including any in-network pharmacy or other prescription drug dispenser, for a prescription drug, inclusive of any _reasonably allocated rebates, discounts, chargebacks, fees, and any additional price concessions received by the plan or issuer_ with respect to the prescription drug or prescription drug service.  The historic net price must be reported at the billing unit level as defined by the NCPDP. The standard contains three units: Each “EA,” Milliliter “ML,” or Gram “GM.”

Further notes for _reasonable allocation of rebates, discounts, chargebacks, fees, and any additional price concessions_.
* If the total amount of the price concession is known to the plan or issuer on the file publication date, then rebates, discounts, chargebacks, fees, and other price concessions must be reasonably allocated by total known dollar amount.
* If the total amount of the price concession is not known to the plan or issuer on the file publication date, then rebates, discounts, chargebacks, fees, and other price concessions should be reasonably allocated using a good faith, reasonable estimate of the average price concessions based on the rebates, discounts, chargebacks, fees, and other price concessions received over a time period prior to the current reporting period and of equal duration to the current reporting period.

The `negotiated_rate` is the rate agreed to pay an in-network provider, including an in-network pharmacy or other prescription drug dispenser, whether directly or indirectly, including through a third-party administrator or pharmacy benefit manager, for prescription drugs. The negotiated rate must be reported at the billing unit level as defined by NCPDP. The standard contains three units “EA,” “ML,” or “GM.” Fees that are assessed at the point of sale must be reflected separately as a dollar amount (see Dispensing Fee, Administrative Fee, and Transaction Fee data elements). 

Fees that are assessed at the point of sale must be reflected separately as a dollar amount (see `dispensing_fee`, `administrative_fee`, and `transaction_fee` data elements).
